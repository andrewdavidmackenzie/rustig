# Test subjects
This project is a workspace that contains multiple projects used for testing of the `rustig` crate. 
These projects are compiled with the default `rustc` version (use command: `rustup show` to check).


## Adding new projects
In order to add a new project, use the command: `cargo new --bin $projectname$`, where `$projectname$` is the name of 
the new test subject.

Additionally, the project needs to be added to the `Cargo.toml` file. In order to do this, extend the `Cargo.toml` 
file by adding a new value to the `members` field, with the value of `"$projectname$"`.

Note that adding, removing or changing a test subject requires a clean build to work properly.
